        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a food that people eat for sustenance. Typically a dinner item it's warm and makes the yum yum in the tum tum. Also really good reheated for a next day lunch type deal. It typically contains meat cheese tomato based sauce and pasta. Very neat.</p>
        <p>Tools needed include an oven, baking pan dish thing and a desire for greatness. I first discovered lasagna on a 3 week backpacking trip across the Himalayas. The dish was hidden at the base of a waterfall near our camp (I was crowned beach volleyball champion) in a tupperware container.</p>
